# ðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒðŸ“ŒEVEN AND ODD NUMBERS FILE READERS (Programming Exercises 1)

This Python program reads a text file named `numbers.txt` that contains 20 integers. The program creates two other text files:

- `even.txt`: Contains all even numbers extracted from `numbers.txt`.
- `odd.txt`: Contains all odd numbers extracted from `numbers.txt`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script `even_and_odd_numbers.py`.

2. Create a text file named `numbers.txt` in the same directory as the script.

3. In `numbers.txt`, add 20 integers, separated by a space.

4. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

5. Run the script


6. The script will output the even and odd numbers from `numbers.txt` and create two text files `even.txt` and `odd.txt`.


## Sample Input and Output

Assume that the `numbers.txt` file contains the following integers:

The script will also create two text files:

**even.txt**
